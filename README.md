Personal Goals
==============

Test driving the "Open-Source Personal Goals" I heard about on the CodeNewbie podcast from Una Kravets

## Overarching Goals for 2020:
1. Study scripture more.
2. Excerise more!
3. Expand my certification set.
4. Learn something new.
5. 

## Big list of ideas
The idea behind this list is to capture all the things I think about (big or small).  So that I can work on them in the future and don't forget them.

This is a pool for drawing ideas from when I have a 'blank' moment.

- [ ] Research RUST
- [ ] Compare RUST to Python
- [ ] Research starting into AI / machine learning.
- [ ] Write book of religious opinions
- [ ] Build out list of interview questions
- [ ] Play more on Nerdcrafteria
